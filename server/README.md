#Node.js Server

The NodeJS server acts as facade of the actual implementation of the ServiceLedger.

The directory *api* contains the definitions of the API defined through Swagger.

The directory *config* contains a yaml configuration file for ServiceLedger, for a Hyperledger Fabric cluster and for a MongoDB server.

The directory *hyperledger-fabric* contains API to integrate it with ServiceLedger and some SUNFISH chaincodes.

Other files and directory are related to the NodeJS server.
